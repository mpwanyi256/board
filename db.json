      "description": "If fans needed any more convincing that this Arsenal team had run out of gas, then their 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest all but confirmed it.\n\nWith the team clearly struggling against Brighton last time out (a 3-0 loss at home), it was evident then, and Arsenal barely laid a glove on Forest, who were fully deserving of their 1-0 win.\n\nThe Gunners, as usual, dominated possession, but one could argue it was as toothless as they have looked in attack all season. The mental and physical toll of the title race has caught up to them.",
